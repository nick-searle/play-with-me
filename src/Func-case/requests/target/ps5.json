I've ran the system for 72 hours straight it has no heating issues. Most of the games I've tested are beautiful graphically and run extremely smooth.(Demon Souls and Assassins Creed Valhalla are the games I've tested and I was not disappointed.) Most games load within 1/10 of the time of the ps4. You can link the ps4 and ps5 to play to some of the games. (Not all ps4 games play well on the system.) The control is a little big in comparison but if you played xbox it's about the same size, it is more responsive than the ps4 controller, it is heavier than ps4 and xbox. In all I'm extremely impressed with the ps5 so far normally I expect some issues with a newly launched system but so far everything has been extremely smooth."
